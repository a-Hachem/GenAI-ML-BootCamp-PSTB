"nice product nice product, perfect package and speed of recording. my camera will stay better with this memory. i recommend for all.",1,1,positive
"good value for memory, could be faster i bought this to go along with my new s4 that i purchased and i have to say i am pleasantly surprised at how much 32gb can get you on a phone! i have pushed all of my apps to my sd card which has given me plenty of free room on my phone (a major detraction placed on the s4 especially). i do notice that since moving most of my apps to the card, some load times and other features may take an extra second to really get going. this may lead me towards going with more powerful sd cards in the future though i am assured this will work for all of my current needs.",1,1,positive
great product what can i say its a micro sd. it serves its purpose and it works just so. i would recommend to others,1,1,positive
"great for asus t100 large storage, perfect for tablets (using it on asus t100, after maxing out 64gb very quickly), but maybe too slow comparing to ssd, as it's the first memory of this kind to reach the microsd format, that's an acceptable tradeoff.",1,1,positive
"very happy with all the storage this little bugger has this itty, bitty sd card packs a whole lot of punch!when i saw how small this was, i was blown away.65gb in something the size of my pinkey fingernail, amazing!i have used it on my camera and my phone.i would highly recommend this to anyone.",1,1,positive

fast and dependable i've heard horror stories about other models but this one is good and it really makes life easier and allows for plenty of storage.,1,1,positive
"just as you expect it to be bought it while it was one sale for $35.... i love itit has given my surface some wiggle room.don't expect the read and write speed to be super fast. most likely you computer doesn't support the current protocol to transfer at the max speed.overall quality you expect from sandisk though i think the price of this can come down bit more, now that the market is slowly moving away from microsd expansion aside from samsung",1,1,positive
"died after 5 months got the sdsdqu-064g-affp-a on december 28, 2012, died on may 20, 2013could not write to it or change any data, no matter what device i used. even after format (full & quick using disk manager & easeus partition master 9.1.1 home edition, connected in a device or adaptor or usb adaptor) when disconnected and reconnected no change. dropbox saved my data luckily (had it syncing using dropsync pro).was using it with samsung galaxy note 2 t889 for the whole time, never was removed.",0,1,positive

works great had to return it because it only formats into certain formats and i needed ntfs which it would not do at the time.i did purchase this again in oct 2013 and found it work as needed. so far it's working great.,1,1,positive
lots of storage i purchased this for my samsung galaxy llls. i never have to worry about running out of storage capacity. thousands of songs don't even make a dent.,1,1,positive
"great while it lasted... i think i got 8 or 9 months out of this before it started to fail. it is still working intermittently but my phone will suddenly stop being able to read it for no apparent reason. &#34;designed for durability&#34; my foot. it might survive in salt water but it didn't survive in a phone that, frankly, doesn't get a whole lot of use. this is the first sandisk product i've ever had fail on me. it may still be under warranty but i don't care. now that i have to replace it i'm going to go with another brand.",0,1,positive
"good, cheap, and works it's been a month now with this sdcard in my phone. i transfer an average of 3gb of data to and from the device per week. the sdcard is holding just fine. where most tend to crap out or cause problems, this has yet to do it.",1,1,positive
"class 10 :) fast, reliable, good brand name and customer service, top of line product. one thing to note is if you don't have a high end device then you don't need a class 10, a class 4 or 6 will yield you the same results. so keep that in mind.",1,1,positive
"good mini sd card! as usual it is a very good product, we like the brand and we keeping buying it for our camares, phones, tablets...",1,1,positive
"fast read, slooooow write :( with a usb 3.0 card reader, crystaldiskmark shows blazing fast 47mb/s read but disappointingly slow 13mb/s write speed. so you can pretty much forget about reliable 1080p video recording.update: it is correct that write speed great than 10mb/s is enough for 1080p recording. i need to clarify that the card is very slow when uhs-1 is not enabled. the read/write speeds drop to 13.3/7.9 mb/s. for devices that are a few years old such as canon t2i which does not support uhs, 1080p recording may not be reliable. this card is classified as ""class 10,"" it should support sustained write speed of at least 10mb/s without uhs. it fails my test, as observed by other reviewers as well.",0,1,positive
sd card it's an sd card. no one has the tools to test whether this is a class 10 with speeds of blah blah blah. it works and that is all that matters.,1,1,positive
nice these sticks have always served me well. this new chip will go in a new asus trans. merry christmas to me.,1,1,positive
"used for mp3 player to gain more space. i use it in my sansa clip zip 8gb mp3 player and now i have 40gb for music.the included adapter allows me to remove the card from my player and add and subtract music using a standard card reader on my computer without having to plug in my mp3 player.when i'm done i slip the micro card back into the player, let the mp3 player refresh itself, and i'm good to go.this card is a class 10 unit so it's also good for expansion ports on video cameras as well.-v-",1,1,positive
good buy great price for a great card. this is a genuine fast sandisk brand card. it has worked flawlessly in my sony dsc-tx200v. pictures transfer to my computer very fast with a usb 3.0 card reader.,1,1,positive

this is great. i use this with my samsung galaxy note 3 and it performs pretty darn well. write and read speed safe good and it stores all my photos no prob.,1,1,positive
good quality card this item is what it is; i've been using it for a few months now and it records hd videos in my gopro hero3 without problems.,1,1,positive
"great storage and fast speed for copying digital slr photos and mp3s. i figured out why my old microsd card died on me. when i plugged in my old android phone at work, the antivirus software of my laptop wanted to scan the whole thing every time. i was plugging it in to charge it, but the constant reads wore out the flash. my new android phone mounts as a cd drive (instead of the entire thing). i can only see the phone if i unmount my cd drive. this is perfect for charging at work now. be careful with virus scanners if you have an android phone that auto mounts your entire phone's micro sd!",1,1,positive
all good so far these things are supposed to work flawlessly aren't they? anyway this does. didn't need to format it in my s4 - went straight in no probs.,1,1,positive

"lots of storage for a reasonable price. this card is fast, fast, fast. it also holds more photos and videos than i have been able to take thus far. however, as the number of such items increases, i can see that i will, relatively soon, be looking for a 128 or 256 gb card. very satisfied with this purchase.",1,1,positive
"great micro sd, just not for a galaxy s3 this does not appear to work with the samsung galaxy s3. it worked for a few weeks, then my phone started giving me ""unexpected unmounted sd card"" error messages. after a bit of searching, people seem to agree that the s3 and sandisk micro sd cards do not work together.",0,1,positive
flawless this is a great little memory device. i now have several and they work without problem with my newer android tablets. (older versions before jelly bean have problems accessing all 64mb - jelly bean works great.),1,1,positive
"sc cards are the best you can get there really isn't much anyone can say that's bad about sd, they are the best around...sc cards are the best you can get",1,1,positive
buy this on all projects i use these for every project i work on. it's a brand i trust and excited to continue with. :),1,1,positive
"no problems yet no problems yet, works fine in htc sensation, it seems kinda slow but i'm thinking it's a problem with my phone interface not the card itself",1,1,positive
"good microsdhc card i got this for my samsung galaxy note. after reading various reviews and comparing different micro sd cards, i decided to get this. one of the main reason was because of the speed of this card (uhs-1). the card has been good to me and i'm happy with my purchase.",1,1,positive

"failed completely after about a month worked fine for a month and then after about a month, the phone didn't see the card any more. tried to read it on several pc's and none of them detected the card. unfortunately it hadn't been backed up so all pictures and videos take on the phone are now gone.",0,1,positive
"good card stil not getting the write speed as i need, but considering the cost /capacity /speed it is a good card!",1,1,positive
"works like a charm! my wife's new galaxy s3 ran out of storage space as we were moving her music library to the phone. ordered two of these, one for her phone and one for mine. installed them in a couple of minutes, and they were immediately recognized by the phone. it couldn't have been easier!",1,1,positive
"perfects, works ok no problem in using it to store medium res video for my kid's android device. works as expected and as described.",1,1,positive
"card works great, adapter is defective. this is the largest capacity micro sdhd card that will work in theasus memo pad smart me301t-a1-bl 10.1-inch 16 gb tablet (blue). the card itself works great, but the adapter is defective. if i didn't already have another adapter, i would have to return this item.",1,1,positive
perfect for my phone for more memory! i needed more memory because my phone kept telling me i was short on memory. this is more than enough memory and i have so many pictures on my phone now! this was a good buy!,1,1,positive
"five stars great buy, works fine - very happy with it.",1,1,positive

i like it the transfer speed is good the picture quality is good it was shipped to me well packed but not over taped up,1,1,positive
went into my new gorpro hero 3 black - camera got hot at first but is working great now. was worried about some articles saying to use 2 x 32gb cards instead but this 64gb card worked out fine for me but was scared when the camera got real hot the first time around.,1,1,positive

"excellent card excellent card that i use primarily in my carcam. has also been used, and been compatible, in a small digital camera with the camera's proprietary adaptor.",1,1,positive
"reliable expansion for your microsdxc needs i wasn't absolutely certain if this would work in my samsung galaxy siii (an sgh-i747m) from a regional carrier here in alaska.i read several reviews, but took a chance the 64gb card would work in my device and was pleased when it arrived.opting for the &#34;frustration free package&#34; it was a very simple matter to open the little cardboard envelop to retrieve the contents. a side note here, i do appreciate the amazon packaging for items such as this, where a clamshell type of container adds no value...the card is well made and seems a quality product. installed the card and it was recognized instantly on boot. the full capacitywas recognized.maybe i am old school when it comes to memory cards, but i always format them in the device i intend on using them (at least initially.) in this case, there were no issues.while i haven't scientifically measured read / write speeds of the card, performance is respectable. i have suffered no issuesrelated to the operation of the card.i would highly recommend this product if you are looking for this capacity and your device will accept the microsdxc format. to that end, several friends have purchased (and been satisfied) with this memory card in their devices.",1,1,positive

good usd card. works great on my galaxy s3. i have not had any issues with it in about a year of ownership.,1,1,positive
"failed after about 5 uses! i purhcased this card for my hero 3 cam. it worked all of last year, or the 3-4 times i used it. i used it again this year and had some great once in a life time ski videos and the card failed. it could not be read or reformatted. i lost all my vids. it was strictly used in my hero 3 cam. i pulled it out to try to retreive the vids using several pc's, multiple card readers, and recovery software but no good. i have never known a card to fail and i am extremely disappointed.try another brand. next time i will use multiple cards with smaller storage and a different brand.",0,1,positive
"great product but watch out for postage scalpers! i've noticed something very crooked online...postage scalpers! charging $8 bucks to mail out micro sd cards that usually come in a small envelope? i mean come on! the ftc needs to crack down on these postage scalpers because they are working in full force these days?i'd say a micro-sd card should mail no higher than a $1.50 to $3.00 bucks but $8.00s????these crooks are demented! i've just been deleting orders out of my cart & will keep doing so till i find one that won't rip me off!great products come from scan disk but buyers beware of these shops who mark these things with high priced postage & then mail it out in a small envelope! and yes almost everyone i've ever ordered came in a small envelope btw...shame on you! i think i'll write my congressman about it! [for whatever good that'll do? w/a 10% rating as they never care what ""we the people"" want!]never the less, you all should be fined by the ftc for committing highway robbery! end of review & hopes this helps others speak out against highway robbery via high postage gauging! as said above i'll keep browsing till i find a good store who won't commit this crime! as my dad likes to say: there's no honest people anymore!one final note: amazon & all of the other online outlets should stop allowing people to charge what they want for postage & only allow them to ship it at cost! a.k.a price figuring via what the item actually ships for at the po,fedx &/or ups!",1,1,positive
"gets the job done i'm not quite sure how to review a memory card, but here it goes... i got the 32gb version and it works perfectly with my galaxy tab 2 7.0...and that's about it haha. the amazon frustration free package was pretty nice and i also liked the little plastic case and micro sd to sd converter it brought.",1,1,positive

"great card i've used the 32gb version of this card since i got it in two android phones and no problems with either phone. it gives me all the music, pictures, downloads, etc. storage i'll ever need. as fast as any other card and faster than most. i also love amazon frustration fee packaging. since there are so many fakes with online retailers, buy from a trusted source like amazon.",1,1,positive
great for tablets! i inserted this little gem in to my new nook hd and let me tell you....wow. she loves it so much and she won't give it back! instead of buying larger capacity tablets....just buy the smallest amount of gigs and buy one of these little dudes.,1,1,positive
not a lot to really be said it's mini storage. it doesn't do anything else and it's not supposed to. i purchased it to add additional storage to my microsoft surface pro tablet which only come in 64 and 128 gb. it does what it's supposed to and sandisk has a long standing reputation that speaks for itself.,1,1,positive
"the best sd card i've ever had i'm using this sd card in my samsung galaxy s3 instead of another one i bought with the same manufacture ""sandisk 32 gb mobile microsdhc flash memory card sdsdq-032g-affp"" ( working perfectly since october 2012.",1,1,positive

"it's fast. it's fast. works as described. plenty of space left free now. fast transfer speeds if used with compatible card reader. would recommend.this product features amazon frustration-free packaging, which is recyclable. it comes without excess outer packaging materials such as hard plastic clamshell casings, plastic bindings, or wire ties. the packaging is designed to be opened without the use of a box cutter or knife, and it will protect your product just as well as traditional packaging.as of this writing, the sandisk ultra microsdhc card ia actually priced lower than other class-10 cards from pny and polaroid. this makes the sandisk the best value - especially if you need honest class-10 performance across all platforms.",1,1,positive
"tiny and mighty i am continually amazed by the fact that this tiny bit of almost nothing can be so powerful. however, i caution anyone buying these micro cards for their gopro that they are extremely easy to lose, but i highly recommend them.",1,1,positive

"64gb micro sdxc works great, better than i thought - if you cave a surface tablet i truly recommend it it will work straight away.",1,1,positive
"works, mostly i bought this to put in my olympus pen e-pm1 camera which takes a standard sd card. therefore it must go into the adapter to be put into the camera. unfortunately there is something touchy about this. sometimes i turn the camera on and get a card error. sometimes i can pop the card out and back in and it'll work. this past weekend i couldn't get it to work at all. i'm guessing it's the camera. or maybe the adapter? when i plugged the card and adapter into my computer to copy the pictures off, it worked perfectly. so i'm not sure what the problem is. i make sure to always carry a spare ""normal"" sd card with my camera in case this one stops working.",1,1,positive
excellent deal of $17.88 for the pricing and it works did not do any tests but it works great in my galaxy note 2. so far nothing wrong to report. recommended.,1,1,positive
"sandisk ultra review so far its been fine, no problems other than when installed phone only read 59.45gb instead of the 64 gb, thats the reason i'm only giving it 4 stars. if anyone can give me a answer why it only read 59 instead of the 64 please let me know!",1,1,positive

"brand name quality. good price, excellent for my camcorder. the micro design was not required for my unit, but gives you flexibility for cell phones, etc. good buy",1,1,positive
"super fast sandisk makes the most reliable sd cards. after working in tech support for a company that relied on maps loaded on sd cards, i only recommend sandisk now. class 10 is great, it means you have the fastest card made. the class shows the minimum speeds for data transfer to and from the card. a class 10 will always have at least a minimum transfer of 10mb/sec. these are the cards professionals use to record hd video and high quality images.",1,1,positive
"it just works i have been using it for several months in a helmet cam, several times a week. no problems so far.",1,1,positive
works...but it is ok for the price...but occasionally it has to be removed and reinserted or the device reports &#34;no card installed&#34; i think the contacts on these are a little flaky.,1,1,positive
well built i got this instead of the black one because it looked better built than the black one. i'm using it with a 8gb stanza sip clip. but the people at sandisk said to use the black one instead,1,1,positive
"probably could have scrimpted and paid less... i just bought two of these for our two new samsung galaxy iv smart phones. the adapters will make it possible for the card readers on our computers to accept these microsd cards if we find it worthwhile to pull them out of the phone case rather than use the usb &#34;dongle&#34; to move information on and off the phones, but.. most importantly, now i don't worry about storing audio books, favorite playlists, and video clips i might want to show someone on the phones.",1,1,positive
"small shipping error, but handled great. good job amazon! i ordered this card for a friend and had it shipped with prime. after about a week my friend still didn't have the card. ok, i called amazon and they had a new card in the mail that day and overnight-ed it. great service on amazon's part!it's a micro sd card, what more can you say about it. if you don't know how to use one then you are just dumb and you should walk into traffic",1,1,positive
"i had a comptibility issue. works great in my modern phone and tablet. however i was unable to use it on my pc's sd card reader. it appears the older card readers are not compatible with class 10 as both my new cards could not be written to without the operating system (win7) reporting write errors.i probably should blame the card reader, but it never failed me until trying to write to this card.",1,1,positive
stuck it in and never looked back! no problems in my note 2. slid what i wanted from the original 16 gb card on to this and couldn't even tell anything had changed. i mean that in a good way.,1,1,positive
great price i picked up this storage device to use in my phone. i only had a 1 gig mini sd in there for music ad it was getting pretty full. now 30 plus gigs of free space later i can download to my hearts content.,1,1,positive
"good memory card. from what i've seen, this memory seems to have the best stats for transfer speeds and whatnot, but i'll let you do that research on your own, as far as the rest is concerned.pros:the packaging was plenty to protect the product.came with the adapter to the full size sd card (most of them do, but this is definitely nice)the price beat those that i could find locally.cons:none really that i can think of.",1,1,positive
"fast, reliable storage i purchased this memory card to use in my samsung galaxy s4 and it worked right out of the box. i haven't had any issues with it at all and the transfer speeds have been excellent. i would highly recommend this or the 64gb version to anyone looking to increase the storage capacity of your mobile phone.",1,1,positive

"fast. with technology improving upon solid state memory extremely quickly, there's no excuse to buy the best in speed, without sacrificing quality.many 32gb cards are class 2/4, which makes them very slow. if you're going to be utilizing 32gb of data for photos/videos, your phone or just super small storage, you're much better off purchasing a faster card such as this. the price is right, and even if it's a little more expensive than the class 2/4 or even 6's, you will regret having pinched a few dollars instead of investing into faster speeds.i currently use this in my sony action cam, and the write speed works perfectly for me, as well as the reading speed to transfer files off the card.",1,1,positive

"unreliable in samsung galaxy s3 i thought this was a sure winner from the average 4.5+ rating with thousands of reviews. but if you notice the bad reviews involve the card becoming unreliable after a couple weeks of use. typically people write reviews shortly after receiving the product. my card worked fine for 2 weeks and then started having problems. i re-formatted the card, re-inserted in the phone, removed the battery, every trick i could read about but the card still remained unreliable and the phone was thinking it was being removed at random times. so i stuck my olders, slower 8gb microsd card in, worked fine.i suspect one or both is happening with this card:(a) some cards are defective but it takes some usage for them to start failing to where the user notices.(b) for some reason, this brand of card doesn't like certain devices, like my samsung galaxy s3my guess is i got a lemon, but i'm not chancing it to getting another one and will just move on to another reputable brand.""you get what you pay for"" may be applicable here. but a lot of others did have success with this card. so ymmv.",0,0,negative

"horrible shipping i ordered two 32gb and two 64gb versions of these memory cards (but i can write only one review per amazon). two 32gb cards went into a camera and a cell phone which only accept up to 32gb cards -- and one 64gb card went into my samsung galaxy s3 cell phone. the second 64gb card's a spare.the galaxy s3 phone accepted the 64gb microsd card with no problems -- except for the fact that my galaxy s3 only recognizes 59.7gb of the 64gb microsd card. i have no idea why it does that and why i lost over 5gb of an empty microsd card but i'm okay with that -- i guess. 60gb's is still plenty. the transfers of music, videos, and pictures between the phone's internal 16gb memory and the 64gb microsd card is wayyy faster than the old sandisk 16gb microsd card that was in there. the same noticeably faster speeds between my desktop computer and the 64gb microsd card were also smile inspiring.as for the sandisk microsd cards -- they work great and seem to operate pretty darn fast. they're definitely faster than the old 16gb sandisk microsd cards i had installed in my camera and cell phone(s).now -- as for the shipping -- dismal! i ordered two 32gb along with two 64gb microsd cards on august 21 during an amazon gold box sale. according to the tracking feature they didn't even transmit the shipping info to the carrier (usps) until august 31. all four were shipped together. i didn't receive them until september 6 -- a full 16 days after i ordered. a little over two weeks for four tiny items that were indicated on the amazon page as being -- ""in stock. ships from and sold by amazon.com"" -- at the time of purchase. they also shipped all four tiny microsd card packages in a way over-sized box which the usps couldn't fit into the mailbox so i had to make a cross-town trip to the us post office and stand in a very long and slow moving line to pick up the box. they could have all four easily fit in one small envelope. even a small padded envelope. i left packaging feedback on that already.this is the 3rd straight time that amazon shipping was horrible over the last several months -- and that is why the 2-star rating. this is not the amazon shipping that i remember.",0,1,positive

"crashed after one month. i installed this on my galaxy note 2 and it crashed after one month. lost all my pictures on the card. had it not been for google plus instant upload and redundant backup to dropbox all of the pictures would have been lost. i think i should get a refund but i did not keep the original packaging. i would not buy this, but if you do keep the packaging so you can return it. if you read most of the reviews you will see that a lot of people have had trouble with this card crashing. i don't think amazon should offer it as it hurts their overall customer satisfaction.",0,1,positive

"will work on android tablets i have read many places that this would not work on android tablets, but have found that the card requires you to format in a windows computer to get it to work. even tablets that are rated to 32gb have been found to read / write this card to 64gb. you need to download a free partitioning program, and format using that to fat32. first erase the current partition, then repartition to 64gb, then format. you can't simply use windows to format to fat32 on newer windows computers, and even on older vista, the max it will allow is 32gb at fat32. using the partitioning software bypasses that 32gb limit and formats the whole card so that when you after insert into tablet reads something like 59.4gb formatted space. huge capacity for the money, and a fast card. search internet for formatting 64gb microsd card for android and read up on it.",1,1,positive

"watch price - great card often on sale my review is a little backwards&#8230; but i thought the most relevant should go first.warning: only buy this card on sale!the *typical* price since summer 2013 is about $24 for 32 gb, and about $48 for 64 gb. do not pay any more than this, and you can actually pay less if you have the luxury of time / patience.the lowest (non-lightning) price hit about $18.00 for 32gb and $35 for 64gb, in early december. i basically buy when the price hits $20 or less, and the 64 nears $40.00.from december 2013 to january 2014, i watched these cards change price on an almost daily basis. they initially went on sale for about $17.95 and $34.95 for 32 and 64 respectively. i watched them slowly increase in price, with random dips and peaks for a month. on january 6th 2014, they still show as a &#34;best deal on amazon&#34; for &#34;7 more days&#34; but they are at the highest price point since last summer -- and higher than i have *ever* payed for these cards! so don't let the &#34;best deals&#34; section deceive you, at $27/$50, these are not a &#34;deal&#34; in terms of price.okay, here's my actual &#34;review&#34; of these absolutely great sdxc cards.****i have tried a variety of microsdxc cards, and so far the samsung ultra uhs1 are the best -- and the price can't be beat -- for all the most important reasons: speed, capacity, reliability, durability.i have not had a single failure, and i use these cards in my nook hd+, nexus 7 2013 (via usb) and my canon 5d mark ii (with converter) and macbook pro (in the card slot). they're durable and waterproof, and i can use the same card in all these devices without reformatting. i even had one go through the wash, and i still use it for pictures.for the technically inclined, i have cards with *both* the clockwork mod bootloader (for the nook hd+) and the magiclantern firmware for my canon eos 5d ii on the same card. i can pull it from the nook, shoot pictures with the camera, and look at the results on the nook by just pulling the card out of one device and placing it in the other. this should be possible with any sdxc/sdhc card, but it turns out that the samsung uhs1 is the only card i've found that works reliably. some cards won't boot because they're too slow too finicky, but all my samsung uhs1s work great (the 64gb will not boot in the nook, but no 64gb card will).i keep my eyes open for price drops on these cards because they've performed so well for me. samsung also has a newer, faster card, but its price-point hovers somewhere north of &#34;prohibitive&#34; so i still stick with these. and that's good news regardless because as the new card increases its market share, these should drop even further in price.",1,1,positive
"does what it is suspose to do. what can i say about a memory card? i purchased it to increase the memory in my phone, it fits as it should, and works as it should.",1,1,positive

"worked for 2 months then stopped if you look through the reviews you will see that this card seems to have both a failure rate and a incompatibility with some devices. i bought this card in november of 2012 and it worked great for a while. the card started failing in my galaxy note 2 in the beginning of january. after reformatting and trying the card in other devices it still does not work. please understand that this is not a user error but appear to be something wrong with the card itself. i have tried the card in 3 different phones. 1 with stock jelly bean, 1 with ice cream sandwich, and 1 with a cyanogenmod custom firmware. all 3 devices have problems and say ""blank sd card"" or ""unsupported filesystem"". even formatting the card in both windows and using android do not seem to fix the issue. i was happy to find such a good price on a large microsd card but sadly it looks like you get what you pay for. it does appear that some people are having luck so it might be worth a gamble of $20 if you are feeling lucky. if you do buy this card it would be wise to double check your backup process to make sure you do not lose pictures or videos if you have this problem. i am glad i used dropbox for my phone so i did not lose any pictures or videos.",0,1,positive

"it works fine not much to say about this other than it works fine. the included adapter was difficult to remove the microsdhc card from, but that may be due to my big fingers (plus the card is very small as one would expect from micro naming). the speed is more than adequate with no buffering issues noticed from video capture on a phone at hd(720) resolution. recommended.",1,1,positive

"used in my samsung galaxy iii - must be taped in though. no issues at all. i have this card in my samsung galaxy iii.it has been in there now for about 8 months with no issues.okay, it had one issue but that was the phone design itself. it would un-mount if the phone was moved around roughly. it seems to pop out very easy in the samsung galaxy phones. so i solved the problem by putting some electrical tape on it to hold it in. so far after 8 months it hasn't un-mounted.it will give you an ungodly amount of storage on this phone. if your wondering if your samsung phone will take this card - it will with no issues. it shows a total of 59.6 gb of available space once installed. a must have since most phones come with 8 gb of internal memory nowadays.",1,1,positive

"32gb for a decent price i've used many others, and this is average. its in my son's android, and i don't really think the application its in right now is a the best way to determine its speed / performance. otherwise it does what i want it to.the adapter will come in handy later.",1,1,positive
works fine well works just like any other sd card i don;t see ultra fast speeds or any thing. i shoved this guy into a galaxy s4 and it works fine!,1,1,positive
"work great with high def action and video cams this is the minimum speed class you want for video recording. there are faster ones, but this does the job and the value is good. make sure to check and see if the camera you are putting this in can take a card of this capacity. seems odd but some don't use a card of more than 32gb, so check first. also check web sites for firmware updates. many cameras did not take these at first but do now. what more can you say about a commodity like memory, get it and store stuff like crazy. to be fair at 1080p this will hold an insane amount of video and images, more than you are likely to shoot on a 2 week trip, but you can always use the extra space as storage and maybe this format will work in your new 4k camera; you will need 65gb then for sure...",1,1,positive
"compatibility issues, very slow write speed this card would not show 64 gb until i spent $60 on a card reader that supports sdxc, and after doing that, it is transferring at class 1 speed. i managed to get it formatted in fat32 with 59 gb free for my cowon j3, but it's taking 10 hours to transfer 30 gb to it. i got a refund because this is not the service and quality i paid for. i just hope the music lists on my pmp when i turn it on tomorrow. i have it in the microsdxc slot of the aft pro-57u, which is connected to a syba via vl800 usb 3.0 card. feel free to tell me i am doing it wrong and how to get class 10 speed.update: the transfer finished, but the data does not show in my cowon j3, so the early versions that worked are gone. do not buy these for a device that is not sdxc specific because they have changed something in them.",0,1,positive
great for dslr pictures were bright and sharp and download from the camera to the card very quickly. if you have a better quality camera this is a great card,1,1,positive
great price for a great product i got the 16gb card for my garmin gps. the gps's memory could be expanded so that more maps and info could be saved. the memory card works as described. i've used sandisk for many electronics and i have never had a problem. they are sometimes a little more expensive than other brands but i think the little extra is worth it.,1,1,positive
works fine the card works with a galaxy note 2. install was simple.there are some minor drawbacks i was unaware of when using card storage on my phone.i do notice an initial lag when first accessing the card.transferring existing items onto card storage is not that simple.not all items can be moved to card storage.,1,1,positive
sandisk is the best! sandisk is the best out there and this ultra is even better! currently using it on a dashcam i have installed in my vehicle. its a shame smart phones seem to be going away with external memory so they can eventually start charging you for cloud storage.,1,1,positive
"scandisk delivers the reliability i need! the scandisk 63 gb sdxc card is a geat value and i get hours of recording hd video with wonderful results. i prefer scandisk because they are reliable. setting up a video shoot with a client, spending hours recording and then calling my client to explain that i bought a cheap, unreliable card that failed... and now i have to reschedule a re-shootand the project will have a late delivery... just isn't smart. i must have reliability and scandisk delivers!",1,1,positive

"great everyone need now how you camera, gps, phone or other gadget can go faster wit a real high speed memory, sometimes we think for example that camera is very slow to recover or open a photo, the gps spend a lot of time charging a route or your phone game think a lot, using a fast memory reduces a lot all time and battery because the gadget no need spend time charging files.",1,1,positive

"plusses and minuses start at four stars.plus one star, because it's finally a 128gb sd card. i have been longing for this for quite some time.minus one star because its performance is spotty. i've been using one in a surface pro for a couple months now, and while the write speeds will peak at a sustained 15mb/sec, it often slows to 1 or 2, even in the middle of a large file copy. i assume that's due to typical flash memory erase cycles or something, but i can't imagine it would be at all reliable for recording video to in your phone.in the end, i like it well enough to get two, but it's really only good for mass storage with low bandwidth requirements.",1,1,positive
"great for android smartphones, cameras, etc you buy a several-hundred-dollars-worth product and then you add up a cheap sd card? what a shame! go for a class 10 sandisk card!! they are very fast and reliable. i use it with my lumix camera and my brother's just bought it for his galaxy s4 mini...",1,1,positive
works perfectly with the surface pro2 product arrived on time not excessively packaged. worked perfectly out of the box. speed is excellent as i can play movies on it and the large file transfer time is very quick on the tablet.,1,1,positive
"it works this was purchased for my cell phone. it was easy to plugged in, and my phone recognized it instantly.the adaptor that comes with the device i had some problems with. the adaptor has a write protection switch, that both my toshiba and hp laptops like to turn on while inserting it into the sd slot. to get around this i have to insert this adaptor at a slight angle, and apply a little pressure to try and not let that switch get changed on insertion. it works, but it is a pain. fortunately since the chip is in my phone 99% of the time it is not a pain i deal with too often. it is something that may need to be considered though if you plan on using this device primarily in the standard sized sd slot of a laptop or computer.",1,1,positive
"great support from sandisk, large cards not recommended while out and about in a photo shoot i had this card fail on me. luckily i'm a backup freak and was just starting out for the day so i only lost a few pictures. card completely died and had to be sent back to sandisk for a replacement.the whole process took a little over a week and communication was excellent so 5 stars on sandisk support.i know about memory so i always have multiple cards available and if i'm out for an extended time, spread my work out over cards to minimize risk.what about the average person who throws all their data on this disk and looses precious memories. sure they are at fault for not backing up their data. unless you are shooting hd videos though, chances are you're not going to fill this card up in a day.unless you either need the storage for hd video or something or your data is not important i'd say it makes more sense to just get several 16gb cards equaling 64gb at roughly the same or less price depending on brand.again sandisk support was great and they even asked if i needed data retrieved. i can't recommend this card though.",0,1,positive

"the only thing better than this would be a 256gb card and a better price. i ordered this before amazon fixed their price and it cost $199 usd. the product is great however it is over priced at $199. i think their 128gb thumb drives go for about $79 usb and were on sale at brick and mortar stores for $69 last week.this is a product that should have been released at least 24 months ago and sandisk is a company that likes to drag its feet and squeeze people with older cards like the 64gb cards.all i can say is where are the 256gb, 512gb, 1tb and 2tb micro sdxc uhs-i or uhs-ii cards? (they all use the ex-fat file system) i have tested my gs3, gs4, note 3 and note pro 12.2 with this card and all of them read it just fine.",1,1,positive

sandisk micro sd. this item was priced right and fit right into my cell phone without any issues. does what it is suppose to do and i don't know what else i could say. being a class 10 it is suppose to be plenty fast for cell phone use which i am sure speeds up camera use to some degree. has worked well and the shipping was fast.,1,1,positive
ships from and sold by amazon.com 64gb sandisk this is the real deal. there are fakes out there and this is not one of them. this shipped directly from sandisk corporation! when purchasing from amazon and the seller is different you never know what you may receive and they (the seller) are not always aware of fakes so you have to contact sandisk to provide the serial code number off the card or send a pic to them so they may authenticate it. it's nice to not have to do that for a change! checked the partition and it's correct. also confirmed this card ir read by lg optimus g pro on at&t network.,1,1,positive

satisfied! love this 32gb micro sd card. i put it in my samsung galaxy note phone. i just returned from a 3 day trip where i used it as my camera/video recorder. i kept it on hd quality the whole time. no problems at all. the only reason i did not give it a 5 star rating was because it actually only had 29gb of space instead of 32. if that is the norm then please excuse my ignorance!,1,1,positive

"no problems in galaxy s2 and evo 3d i bought three of these and all three worked upon initial installation with no formatting. using my notebook computer's built in sd card reader, i saw transfer speeds between 6 mb writing and 14 mb reading. this was doing a simple ""copy / past"" of all files on my old card that i had saved to my computer. these speeds are much slower than the stated maximum by the card manufacturer, but would be expected with over 12,000 small files like my example. the read / write times were close to 50% faster than those of my old 8 gb class 10 sandisk micro sd card, so there is definitely a performance gain with this updated card.all things considered, 16 gb of storage on a class 10 card from the leading manufacturer, and at $15 is a steal. i highly recommend this card.",1,1,positive

"awesome. i gave it five stars, simply because i am not a tech genius, so i don't know if it is the best or not - but jeez, this thing is fast and it does everything that i wanted it to do. i have no complaints so far. i'm a very happy customer and i would definitely recommend this product to someone who is looking at buying an affordable micro sd card.",1,1,positive
"no problems i searched for an inexpensive 64 gb micosdxc card for my new samsung galaxy note 10.1 2014 edition (32gb) tablet and this one caught my eyes regarding positive comments and price. the note was a christmas gift and it will be used for media entertainment while on business travel and as a replacement for an aging toshiba notebook. there were no problems with the install ... the card was recognized upon boot-up after the installation. i don't require great transfer speeds for my tasks. a quick test using es file explorer copying a 400 mb media file from the tablet os card to this expansion card yielded 10 mb/s write and 40+ mb/s read speed, which is more than sufficient for all my tasks. as a bonus, i added this card to my shopping cart at $46.99 and the following day the price dropped to $37.99. that was all the incentive needed to push the &#34;place your order&#34; button. i can't speak much of reliability since i've had the card installed for less than two weeks. so far it has been stable.",1,1,positive

"shame on sandisk, very low write speed! the description is quite confusing - it says at same time class 10, which means that you should not expect write speed higher than 10mb/sec, and at the same time, it says uhs-1, which means 30mb/sec write speed. the truth, as usually, is somewhere in the middle, but close to lower end. i have a dedicated, high speed pci-e cardreader, which i use for chip benchmarking. so, this card showed 12mb/sec sequental write speed and 34mb/sec sequental read speed. so, uhs-1 is ""true"" only for read operations, meaning that if you wanted this card to speed-up your digital camera speed photography - you've made the wrong choice. just for reference, this cardtranscend 16 gb class 10 microsdhc flash memory card ts16gusdhc10has sequental write speed of 17mb/sec and sequental read speed of 24mb/sec. as you see, the cheaper transcend has average 40% faster write speeds!",0,1,positive
great solution for more memory on the galaxy s4 i upgraded from my 8 gb sd to this one and it was great to have the extra space.no problems with it.i removed the sd card from my phone and copied the files up to my computer using the adapter that came with the new card. i copied the files to my new 32 gb microsdhc and installed it in my galaxy s4 and it worked great.i liked the color. makes it easier to see on my black desk.,1,1,positive

"works as advertised i don't have too much to say about an sd card, but i wanted to at least give it the 5 stars it deserves. we used it in a galaxy s3 and it has worked flawlessly so far. i haven't run any benchmarks to confirm the speed, etc but it does not seem to hinder the phone or camera (which we now have saving photos/videos to the sd card) in any way.i will point out the the s3 camera app did notify us that burst mode shots will still write to the phone's internal memory. potentially due to the high date of data being written. that's good to know if you use burst mode a lot and were hoping to use an sd card for that purpose.",1,1,positive

good product what can i say - its a memory card. it remembers what its supposed to. at least it remembers as well or better than i do.only problem i have with these micro sd cards is - they're so small they're easy to lose. if these things get any smaller we will start inhaling them by accident when we sneeze or something.,1,1,positive

"good addition to gopro gig bag these cards worked flawlessly with the gopro hero 3+. instead of opting for the bigger card, i got two smaller cards to start with. that way i could transfer data to my laptop while still using the other card. if you're wanting to do an un-assisted, large record, like a time-lapse, or something, opting for the bigger card is smart, but for my usage being able to swap back and forth was invaluable.so far, no hiccups or problems, even with the faster, more beefy shooting settings.",1,1,positive
"best deal around bought it with retail packaging, arrived legit, in a orange envelope, english version not asian like the picture shows. arrived quickly, bought a 32 and 16 both retail packaging for my htc one sv and lg optimus, both cards in working order, probably best price you'll get for a nice sd card",1,1,positive

"great value! i've been buying sandisk for awhile, but i have yet to experience how durable and fast they are until now!when accessing video or photos on my phone, they do not hesitate to load.

"good flash card i had bought this card for my new samsung galaxy s3. the card is about as good as you can expect for the price and technology you're paying for.sdxc cards come formatted in exfat by default, which is what i would have tried to format it as anyway and seen if my phone supports that filesystem. in addition to being a faster format, enabling higher transfer rates, exfat also takes up less storage space than, say, an fat or fat32 filesystem would - which is important when considering mobile storage devices.i read several poor reviews about this product starting that it simply stopped working after a few months. while that can happen from regular use, as it has happened to me in the past with a couple 32gb sdhcs, i would venture to say it was an error in use. flash media is very sensitive in regards to ""hard shutdowns"". that's to say, just pulling it out of your device or card reader without first unmounting it. within the 'data storage' menu on android phones, there is an option to 'unmount sd card'. i would recommend that you always select this before removing any external memory card to avoid corruption of data and, ultimately, the card itself. the reason for this is that sudden stoppage of a flash memory device's data or power connectivity can easily result in corruption.transversely, if you have the memory card plugged into a card reader, say, with an sd adapter; you should first ""eject"" the card. in windows, there is a small icon located in the taskbar notification menu for ""safely remov[ing] hardware and eject[ing] media"". select the card and a notification will pop-up that the card is now safe to remove. it basically severs the same function as the android 'unmount' optional but will also cease any current read/write operations to avoid data or device corruption.i cannot speak for how one would do this on a mac os but chances are, if you're using an apple pc, you don't have an android phone.",1,0,negative
"it works! it has lots of space! it's fast! what more can you ask of it? i purchased this to go into an external wireless connect drive that is made by the same manufacturer. other than having to format it differently than the default (a very simple process), i have not experienced any issues with it.",1,1,positive
it still works i did not do any bench tests to see to verify the read and white but been very happy with it.,1,1,positive
"so far, so good only had it a few days, but so far it seems to work fine. one thing to be aware of - the adapter came with the little slider switch in write protect mode. i could not write on the memory card from my laptop because of that, and almost embarrassed myself by asking sandisk for support - the i realized what the problem was. i give 10% of the blame to sandisk since the slider has no visual indication at all. a little dab of white ink would gave helped. but mostly, it was me :-) anyway, just be aware of this if you use the adapter.",1,0,negative
"have card; will travel full disclosure: i use no other brand of sd card other than sandiskhaving said that, i was pleased to discover an sd card designed for people who demand fast transfer speeds for hd video applications. i purchased this item for my tablet pc and have been pleased with its functionality. the adapter is great for accessing via computer to transfer files directly if usb is not desired.",1,1,positive

"true to class i big problem i have been having lately is finding a trustworthy source for sd cards. they are manufactured in china and these rip off companies are selling fake cards at a competitive price, but don't be fooled. if the price seems unbelievable that is because you will end up with a card that is not only less capacity then you are paying for, but a lower class and sometimes a faulty card altogether.when it comes to storage, pay the extra cash to get something reliable. like this sandisk ultra 64 gb sdxc class 10 memory card. it is blazaing fast and works well in my htc evo lte android phone.side note: this card brings my total phone storage capacity to 158 gb. that is 158 gb that i have full access to. 85 gb of which is synced to the cloud.",1,1,positive

"works nicely i got this to upgrade my surface pro 2's storage and it works nicely, what do i store on it? bunch of mp3's and games on steam.it works well, the games run fine, boot pretty quick, the one issues i had was installing the games, sometimes the card would vanish from the drive and i'd have to pop it in and out to get it to go again, however i feel like that could be software related as nothing like that happened while playing a game.best idea is to install the game on the surface, move the files over manually to the card, &#34;tell steam to uninstall the game&#34; to erase it from the list, then hit install, point it to the folder on the card, then it'll spot the files, download only a few things and bam, it works.about the card itself, i wouldn't rely on multitasking off this thing, as it's not meant for that- as in if you're playing music off this card, do not install a game at the same time. it's fast at 1 thing, not many.",1,1,positive

"failed in 1.5 months do not put any important data in it. do not use it as a permanent storage to archive important files.it just failed after 1.5 months use -- i don't use it too much. just put all my digital pictures (total: about 30gb) in it and carried in my wallet. i added some more pictures to the disk for a few time in november. tonight, when i insert it into my laptop, windows say cannot recognize the disk and said it must be formatted. i tried my macbook air and got the same. neither mac nor windows can read it. i formatted it and started to copy the 30+gb pictures again. the copy broke in half way. cancelled the copy, reinserted the disk and tried to resume the copy. windows said the volumn is back and told me i must run chkdsk. i ran chkdsk and retried the copy. still the same failure.i guess the disk has some problem and i don't bother recovering it, since it's not going to be reliable as i expected. very disappointed. thought sandisk is a very good brand. i use sandisk's cf card in my camera for years and it worked fine. i will fall back to use hard disk to backup my ditigal pictures.so it should be find to use this microsd disk to exchange some large file with friends. but don't put important data in it. be prepard that it can fail at any time.",0,0,negative
great card for lots of memory works great does what it says it will do. price has come down over the years and quality has improved. i use it in my note 3 and it does a great job. when i fill it up i put everything on an external hard drive and the card can be used over and over and over again.,1,1,positive

"not bad for being so tiny i bought this card because i hope to transition from a pc to a smartphone in the near future. for now i use an adapter to run it on the pc. the write times aren't as good as i had hoped, but they're acceptable overall. plenty of storage space for my files, some of my music, pics, that sort of thing. have also run portable applications on it and they seem to perform well for the most part. overall, a solid little card with just enough speed to get the majority of my tasks done.sidenote: the card came formatted with exfat by default. the onyl way i could downgrade to fat32 was to use a third party app. for some reason, the card can't be read by my phone, but the phone is an older model samsung, so that could be the issue.",1,1,positive
check your phone docs before ordering a microsd card for it the docs for my smart phone said that this card would work in it. after talking to sandisk support i was told that a 32gb card was the max for my phone. so i returned this card for a 32gb. this card is probably a very good product. just the documentation for my phone was bad.,0,1,positive

"galaxy note 2 to begin, i am not that knowledgeable in tech matters so when i received a new galaxy note 2 as a gift and decided to add storage i read some reviews on the sd cards and was reading about the compatibility of the 64 gb cards (exfat or fat? i guess the exfat was a successful diet), i was concerned somewhat but i ordered this one anyway and this is what my experience was. i added some music and videos onto the card using my apple macbook air with no problems and then inserted it into the note 2 with no problems and it immediately loaded everything with no problems. i have since taken it out and added some more music to it and it is working perfectly. i did not reformat or anything like that which was a great relief. although i have only used this item for a week now with issue which means something could go wrong in the future, i would give it more than 5 stars if possible because it was easy for someone like me. i know i used the phrase no problems multiple times but when you are my age and things go smoothly with no problems it is very good.",1,1,positive
"looks good, the package is horrible though the card looks good, works fine, i didn't do too much test with it.my only complaint until now is the package, there's a line marked on the back for you to cut, i cut along the line, and nothing happened, no opening at all, all cardboard glued tightly. so i cut near the card, only to found i cut the supposed plastic card case/storage shell, now i took it out, and no storage case to store. not a functional problem, but annoying.",1,1,positive
"outstanding product used with my gopro hero 3 black edition and it works like a charm! it comes with the adaptor to use in a regular sd card slot, or can be read with any microsd card reader with no issues. pushing video, even high quality, high frame rate video to this card is flawless.",1,1,positive

"64gb.... more than enough.... for now i used this on my android tablet (pantech element and my galaxy s3 phone). the s3 took it without an issue but the pantech required me to format it as fat32.... it wouldn't read it any other way.... you can search the internet for fat32 formatter which will format the card as fat32 using an external card reader within seconds.after doing that, i've been using it for a few weeks now with no problems. very nice. now... just waiting for the 128gb model. :)",1,1,positive

"great card, works with no problems. i've had this for about a week now and so far no problems. due to my laziness, i didn't do a lot of research beforehand and didn't find out about the problem these cards had with the galaxy s4, which is the phone i have, until after i had bought the card (apparently the cards kept unmounting themselves, even if you remounted it in the settings). fortunately, sandisk caught wind of the problem a couple months ago and fixed it, so kudos to them.",1,1,positive
"fast, easy to use i bought the 64gb version for my samsung galaxy note ii and it works great. didn't need to format or anything. opened the box, popped it into my phone and it worked just as expected. transfer speeds via usb connected to the phone and direct via card reader are both fast.i also bought the 32gb version to use (with included sd adapter) in my canon sd4500is. again, just popped it directly into my device and it was ready to go. very happy with both products. i've used many sandisk flash cards in the past without issue so i expect these will hold up extremely well over time as well. it might be a few more bucks than some lesser known brands, but i feel its worth the premium.",1,1,positive
"it's 64gb it's 64gb and it's in my phone. really, that's all you need for a review. what more could you want? i have all my music, several movies and i can record stuff on camera at full hd without worrying about running out of space. no issues at all. did i mention it's 64gb?",1,1,positive

"perfect for samsung galaxy s4 i had to format it as fat32, you can google for how to do that, but once you do, it works great. i'll never understand why people would ever buy a phone that doesn't have a microsd slot. with this you can fill it up with whatever you want, such as movies, tv shows, music, and share it with whoever you want. just pop it in your phone and you are all set for a long trip, airplane ride, etc. i never need to worry about running out of space when taking full hd videos either.",1,1,positive

"works great, note 3! i have room! whoo hoo okay, i'm a memory hog. i admit it.the note 3 has 32gb internal storage and it's nearly full. i had a 64gb microsd card in it and guess what? 15gb left! so what's a geek to do?buy this! wow, what breathing room i have! and then some! i copied the entire 64gb card to the 128gb card, and then added more hd movies. in addition to the phone's stuff, i have all 6 star wars movies, the back to the future trilogy, and the indiana jones movies on this card and room for plenty more. no doubt when the note 4 comes out, i'll be ready with a kick-butt memory card.the note 3's specs state that it will accept cards ""up to 64gb"". well, at the time 64 was the highest card available, so they couldn't possibly test for a higher capacity. phandroid / android forums, however, has a fairly comprehensive list of devices that are compatible with this card, accurate to the date of the article:[...]so i'm a happy camper. yes, i paid a premium for being an early adopter... but i'll be saving my pennies for the inevitable black friday sale in november, which will be just about the time the note 4 is released. folks, i can't recommend this card enough: just make sure you're backing up to a pc regularly! if it does fail, you definitely want your precious pics and data backed up.",1,1,positive

"great product, this was cheapest price i wanted one of these badly, in fact i ordered two. aside from someone stealing the first package they sent me, i am glad i could just go on amazon, see the super cheap price and have it delivered in 2 days, which is quicker than i could go and get one living here in nyc. now i have tons of stuff i can quickly load onto it and put into my asus transformer t700 instead of waiting for the super slow usb cable transfer directly to the tablet. the other one i put in my galaxy s4, which is sheer overkill but i dont have to worry about running out of space",1,1,positive

"brilliant! price beats iphone's $200 price for 64gb phone by $150! this is the best accessory that you can buy for your smartphone! simple explanation:1) i loaded all my hd movies onto this micro sd card, inserted it into my samsung galaxy s3, and it plays them superbly without any delays, as it it up to 30mb/s read speed!2) the most important reason for this being the best accessory for your phone is to think about this: the premium you pay for an iphone 64gb is $200. the price you pay for this 64gb micro sd card is $50 (depends on amazon's pricing at the time). that means you get the same thing for $150 less, and you can interchange your sd card between devices (if you buy a new tablet for example).no brainer.note that it reads only at 10mb/s, so a 7gb hd movie will take about 10 - 15 minutes to load up.",1,1,positive
"no problem; it fits and it seems fast no problem; it fits and it seems fast. the colors are a good addition because when it pops out on the floor or something, you can find it.",1,1,positive

"dead card do not buy, card failed on the third usage. kicker not to my favoris you only have about 2 months to return this card for a full refund.then, it's a pro rated rated deal when you send it back to amamzon inlexington, ky.the failed card was in a gopro white edition. needless to say, a camera thatwas purchased for summer outdoor usage in november is going to sit for quite awhile before you have time to get your money back. card sat all winter and failedtowards the end of april. 6 months lag to get a decent, even pro rated refund.out of all the items i bought from amazon this is my only bad experience.64 gigs crammed on a tiny micro sd card is too much. i'll stick with thesmaller 32 gigs until this technology is meant to last.refund update, once again amazon did the right thing anbd refunded full purchase pricefor the dead 64 gig. amazon is where i shop for 2 reasons. 1. i live 50 miles frombig box stores and 2. they always make things right with no muss ...no fuss.i replaced the dead card with amazon brand micro 32 gig sd micro card.i have purchased amazon branded sd cards before and they work just as good as any.not to mention the cost savings.",0,1,positive

"very fast card this card was able to transfer all my pictures, movies, music, and toast from my hard drive to my cell phone very fast. although, i don't necessarily believe that you need the fastest card for your cell phone, if you can afford it, i would get it. having a snappy cell phone being able to process and write to an sd card extremely fast makes you happy.",1,1,positive
good fast card. phone is a galaxy s3 from virgin. still getting sd card unexpectedly removed but i do know it's an issue with the phone and not the card.,1,1,positive
"great microsd cards i bought 2 of these, 1 to use in a stealthcam(with the included adapter) and 1 to use in my tablet(an acer a500). so far the card has worked flawlessly for both applications. i chose to use the microsd card to make it possible to copy the pictures from my trail cameras using my tablet in the woods. removes the need for a dedicated viewer or to tote a laptop or extra cards.",1,1,positive
"sandisk ultra 32 gb microsdhc with adapter great item with most tech items that are current in design. great microsdhc c10/uhs1 disk with memory card adapter. great product and does with my tablet and netbooks and laptops.the speed of the data is good as well. i would say please get this item, and the price is good as well.",1,1,positive
"after 2 years..... still working fine in my galaxy sii. no complaints. i do have a complaint about my galaxy occasionally erasing everything on it, but i'm sure that's not the card's fault.",1,1,positive
what's not to love? excellent price for the amount of storage and speed. i just washed this in the washing machine and was preparing to buy another. after checking it for errors it came up with none. needless to say i don't have to buy another but did feel compelled to write a review. cheers!,1,1,positive

great storage low price microsdxc is the wave of future storage for any manufacturer that has any sense. these little cars can increase the storage capacity of the most basic of devices for far less than buying more expensive models that don't allow external storage. easy to use and with an industry standard that expands up to 2tb in capacity.,1,1,positive

"make sure to format this! you need to format this card to fat32 before using it in your cell phone, otherwise it will not work. my samsung galaxy s3 kept giving me beef until i did so. it's handy to have a laptop sitting around that has a port that can take this card with its adapter in.luckily i had one such laptop lying around. otherwise, this card works great and holds quite a bit of space. giving it 4 stars for the initial grief with formatting it. iirc i used a tool called fat32 format, but it's on my laptop so i haven't checked.",1,1,positive
"memory card we use these for our samsung galaxy 4s phones and they are amazing because i can now take a gazillion pictures! i only wish that i could separate the pictures on the memory card into folders but that is a samsung issue, not the memory card issue.",1,1,positive

"great memory card i use this card in smasung galaxy s4 active and before that i used it in my samsung galaxy note 2. it has always worked flawlessly and never given me a single problem. i use the card to copy movies to it. playback is always smooth. i mostly play high definition movie rips. these require a lot of processing power and data transfer from the card. it has always done great. i will continue to buy this card. i have one in my macbook air for backups. again, no problems.- damon",1,1,positive
"can't handle recording 1080/60p video on galaxy note 2 i have to assume that the brand new 64gb sandisk ultra class 10 sdxc card is responsible for the occasional video recording stutter/pausing that has happened since i started using it today. prior to that, never had an issue with my previous sandisk sdhc card. but today on its maiden trip, it has led each video (only 3-5 minutes long each) to have several performance issues that by default i have to attribute to the card since nothing else has changed and i've never had an issue in the four months that i've had my galaxy note 2. no problems formatting this card though or installing/using it otherwise.",0,1,positive
seems to be working just fine... i work for ready 2 roll pedicabs in houston and we do a lot of promotional movies and put them on youtube. we use this memory card for our full hd cam... so far we recorded 5 hour on full hd and still have plenty of space for more hours. it just took a few day when i received it in the mail.,1,1,positive

"works great in my gopro hero 3 there really isn't much to say about this card other than it's been very reliable and handles hd video from my gopro hero 3 very well and without a glitch.i'm not offering any benchmarks or other measurements of speed in comparison to other class 10 microsd cards. all i can tell you is that this card has yet to fail me and i am a longtime video professional who works in a commercial/advertising/marketing environment, so i need things to be reliable for all of my clients.recording and transferring video from device to computer is a snap and i've had no issues with it since i began using it.",1,1,positive

"working perfectly in my droid razr maxx altough motorola says the droid razr maxx only supports a 32gb card, i've read many reports of people using this 64gb card, so i took a chance with it.i formatted it in my phone and started loading music and movies onto the card by connecting my phone to the computer with the usb cable.note: i had read to not format the card in the computer because it will only show up as 27gb of memory available - i was careful to heed this advice, though did play with it in the computer itself (without formatting it, just looking) and it does only show up as 27gb . however, in my droid it definitely shows as 64gb (well 59 and change)so far the card is functioning as it should: i have played music, looked at pictures, and watched a little bit of a movie, all stored on the card, and eveerything seems to be working iin blissful droid perfection.",1,1,positive

"good solid card what can i say? this card just works. i'm honestly not a fan of sandisk since their 64gb ultra microsd died on me soon after my baby was born. i lost several weeks of photos, and i was quite angry.to be fair, they did send a new one after i sent them a photo of the old one snapped in half.",1,1,positive
"why???? i bought this on black friday last year and took a chance on it. what chance u say? i read some reviews that this card just actually stopped working for no reason and not due to abuse or misuse. i had this card in my acer iconia a500 and it just stopped working! even my computer doesnt recognize it. wtf sandisk?? this is an expensive part for this to occur. do not buy or if u do, be careful what u store on it! i only had music and movies on mine so nbd. but what if u had this in your phone with valuable pictures?",0,0,negative

"great, fast, huge i bought this as an expanded/backup memory for my tablet (a samsung galaxy tab 3), and it installs easily, works quickly, and even has a great sandisk memory app that helps me organize my files and see a visual representation of how much memory is taken and how much is free.it came with an adapter so i can plug it into my computer to transfer files if i want to, which is awesome. nothing bad to say about this memory card!",1,1,positive
lots of storage i bought this card to extend the storage capability of my tablet. it holds hundreds of my short video files without having to use the tablet's built in memory. transfer speed from my computer into the card is relatively fast. if someday i may need more storage in the tablet i can always buy another one of these cards.,1,1,positive

"my android tablet is all growed up! my android tablet is a toy; there is nothing crucial on it. i plan on downloading maps for travel, and need more storage.i rooted my tablet, changed two lines in a control file, and now it sees the external card as the internal card (and vice versa). when i save apps and/or data to the sd card, everything goes to the 32gb sandisk ultra microsdhc card instead of the puny internal store! woo-hoo!disclaimer: rooting a device usually voids its warranty. i am not condoning such action, nor am i responsible for the results of such action. the responsibility is yours.the tiny card fit into the tiny slot on my 9&#34;-screened tablet, and is invisible once installed. but we both know it's there! i couldn't be happier, and until that changes, this is my endorsement of the sdhc card.",1,1,positive

"great idea... ...to have both the micro and the adapter in the same package. i only had to buy one package to get the items i needed for my smartphone and my digicam. i replaced the 2 gig micro in my phone with the 32 gig one, then reformatted my 2 gig micro to be used in the adapter for my camera, then uploaded photos to my laptop using the adapter.i would have given it 5 stars, but the adapter stopped working after only 2 months! truthfully, though, i don't know if it's because the product is defective, or if i just handled it too much or incorrectly. so i feel 4 stars is fair.",1,1,positive

"a must for smartphones and tablets i'm not a heavy user of data but enough that my pictures and music videos wouldn't fit on the factory 4 gig card. you can never have enough memory as it gets used up quick. it has the advertised memory capacity rating and has improved speed on my smartphone and tablet when moving pictures and videos to different folders. no lag compared to the cheap factory memory card. buy the better card the first time, you won't be regretting it later. would recommend and buy again",1,1,positive
"great quality i use this in my samsung galaxy note ii. for the money, it's a fantastic value. i haven't noticed any transfer speed issues, and it's been rock-solid reliable for the 3 months i've owned it. i have about 32gb of music stored on it, and every app that can use sd card storage is set to do so, including all my system backups. the ultimate &#34;install and forget&#34; add-on for your phone!",1,1,positive

Now complete the following steps:

#  **Step 1: Initial Summary Prompt**
Write a few-shot or Chain-of-Thought prompt to summarize the document in plain English.

Your summary should include:

Key responsibilities of each party
Payment terms
Termination clauses
Liability limitations

Prompt 1 : 
"You are a legal assistant helping non-lawyers understand contracts.

First, analyze the document step by step:
1. Identify what services the Provider offers.
2. Identify the Client’s obligations.
3. Note the payment details.
4. Check for how the contract can be terminated.
5. Examine liability limits.

Then, based on your analysis, write a short summary in plain English.

Here’s an example:

Example:
Document:
"The IT firm will install security software and maintain it monthly. The client pays $3000/month, and the contract lasts 6 months. Either party can cancel with 1 month’s notice. The firm is not liable for data loss."

Summary:

💬 Step 2: Role-Based Follow-Up Q&A
Write a role-based prompt where the assistant takes on the role of a contract lawyer answering user questions about this agreement.

Example: “Can you explain the limitation of liability clause?”

Use Narrative-of-Thought or Instance-Adaptive CoT to deliver engaging and helpful responses.

Response :
"You are an experienced contract lawyer providing advice to a non-lawyer client.  
Your role is to help them understand each part of the contract clearly and confidently.

When answering a question:
1. Read the question carefully and identify which clause(s) it refers to.
2. Reflect step by step on what this clause means in context.
3. Explain your reasoning in a natural, narrative style, as if speaking to a client in a meeting.
4. Use simple, plain English with examples if needed.
5. If relevant, mention practical consequences or things to watch out for.

        "##  **Introduction**  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we will build an **AI-powered document retrieval system** using **LlamaIndex**, **FAISS**, and **Google Flan-T5 Large**. Instead of using OpenAI's GPT models, we leverage **Flan-T5 Large**, a Hugging Face model, to process queries and generate responses.  \n",
        "\n",
        "## **Objectives:**  \n",
        "1. **Set up the environment** → Install and configure essential libraries.  \n",
        "2. **Load documents** → Extract text from PDFs using `SimpleDirectoryReader`.  \n",
        "3. **Segment the documents** → Split text into meaningful chunks with `SentenceWindowNodeParser`.  \n",
        "4. **Generate embeddings** → Convert document segments into numerical representations using `HuggingFaceEmbedding`.  \n",
        "5. **Store embeddings in FAISS** → Index document embeddings for fast similarity search.  \n",
        "6. **Perform document retrieval** → Use **Flan-T5 Large** to process queries and retrieve the most relevant document segments.  \n",
        "\n",
        "By implementing this pipeline, we create an efficient **semantic search engine** that can process and retrieve relevant information from large document collections using a **local LLM (Flan-T5 Large)** instead of cloud-based OpenAI models. 🚀  \n"
